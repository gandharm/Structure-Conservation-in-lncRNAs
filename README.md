# Structure Conservation in lncRNAs
## Summer and Fall, 2020
Scripts written for the analysis of RNA sequence alignments. <br />
Also, my implementation of the Hough Transform in Python OpenCV to catch structural motifs in RNA secondary structures. <br />
As used in "Towards a more robust structure-guided conservation prediction tool for lncRNAs".
